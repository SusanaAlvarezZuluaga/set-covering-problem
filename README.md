# Set covering problem
- The set covering problem (SCP) is a classical question in combinatorics, computer science, operations research, and complexity theory. It is a problem "whose study has led to the development of fundamental techniques for the entire field" of approximation algorithms. 
- The problem consists in given a set of elements called the universe and a collection of sets whose union equals the universe identifying the smallest sub-collection of sets whose union equals the universe. 
- I used MATLAB to implement algorithms to find initial solutions for the SCP and then these solutions where improved using various variable neighborhood search algorithms and genetic algorithms.
- In the repository you can find three folders: initial-solutions-algorithms, variable-neighborhood-search-algorithms and genetic algorithms. Each one of these folders contains three subfolders: datos, src, resultados. The datos folder contains different instances of the SCP that where used to test the algorithms, the src folder contains the source code which can be run running the main file and the resultados folder contains the results obtained when running the algorithms
